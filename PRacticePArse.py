The mitotic deacetylase complex (MiDAC) is a recently identified histone
deacetylase (HDAC) complex. While other HDAC complexes have been implicated in
neurogenesis, the physiological role of MiDAC remains unknown. Here, we show that
MiDAC constitutes an important regulator of neural differentiation. We
demonstrate that MiDAC functions as a modulator of a neurodevelopmental gene
expression program and binds to important regulators of neurite outgrowth. MiDAC 
upregulates gene expression of pro-neural genes such as those encoding the
secreted ligands SLIT3 and NETRIN1 (NTN1) by a mechanism suggestive of H4K20ac
removal on promoters and enhancers. Conversely, MiDAC inhibits gene expression by
reducing H3K27ac on promoter-proximal and -distal elements of negative regulators
of neurogenesis. Furthermore, loss of MiDAC results in neurite outgrowth defects 
that can be rescued by supplementation with SLIT3 and/or NTN1. These findings
indicate a crucial role for MiDAC in regulating the ligands of the SLIT3 and NTN1
signaling axes to ensure the proper integrity of neurite development.

BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have found more than 20 genes 
associated with a risk of non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate
(NSCL/P). However, the interactions between these risk genes have been rarely
reported.
METHODS: Here we selected 47 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) from previous 
GWASs and tested for possible interactions among 302 NSCL/P case-parent trios
from a western Han Chinese population to further explore the genetic etiology of 
NSCL/P. Conditional logistic regression models were performed including gene-gene
(G×G) interaction.
RESULTS: Twenty pairwise interactions yielded significant p-values. Most of the
signals of interaction between the SNPs were detected at the same gene including 
v-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene family, protein B (MAFB), netrin 1
(NTN1), and single nucleotide polymorphic marker within interferon regulatory
factor 6 (IRF6). We found evidence of the interaction between rs17563 (bone
morphogenetic protein 4, BMP4) and rs560426 (subfamily A member 4/Rho GTPase
activating protein 29, ARHGAP29) (P=0.00093) in NSCLO trios.
CONCLUSIONS: Gene-gene interaction between markers in BMP4 and ARHGAP29 may
influence the risk of NSCLO in western Han Chinese population, which might
explain the missing heritability for NSCL/P.

HDFa (human dermal fibroblasts) are used as cellular models for EMF exposure. To 
ensure reproducible in vitro experiments, comparable proliferation and
differentiation cell conditions must exist, and different donors, passage
numbers, culture time, and growth media must be considered. In this study, the
authors cultured fibroblasts in DMEM or 106 medium. Growth curves, vitality,
morphology, and gene expression of genes coding for proliferation (PCNA, CDKN2A, 
CDKN1A, SFN), differentiation (PDGFRA, TGM2, ACTA2, PDPN, NTN1, MGP, PPP1R14),
and SFN target genes (TP63, MMP1, MMP3) were examined in both media and passage
numbers 3-4, 5-6 and >6. At passages 3-4, proliferating cells can be observed in 
both media. While cells cultured in DMEM proliferate over the passages, from
passage 5, cells in 106 medium persisted around the seeded number. TGM2
down-regulation over all passages in both media and cells morphology suggest
papillary-type fibroblasts. Downregulation of SFN (negative regulator of mitotic 
translation and cell differentiation) coincided with proliferating fibroblasts
over all examined conditions. Downstream SFN target genes in proliferating cells 
appeared upregulated (TP63) and downregulated (MMP1/MMP3), suggestive for a
status characterized by increased stemnesses (upregulated TP63) and wound healing
capacity (downregulated MMP1, MMP3). Resting cells (SFN control values) were
associated with control values of TP63 and MMP1/MMP3 expression, suggesting a
reduced stemness and wound healing capacity. In conclusion, a set of markers
related to proliferation (SFN), differentiation (TGM2), stemnesses (TP63), and
wound healing (MMP1/MMP3) allow a culture characterization so that cells under
two different conditions can be exposed, thus enabling reproducible EMF
experiments or experiments with other exposures.
